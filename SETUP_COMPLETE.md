```

## How to Run

### Quick Start

```bash
./build_and_run.sh
```

That's it! The app will build and launch automatically.

### What to Expect

1. **Look for "App Manager ▼" in your menu bar** (top-right of screen)
2. **Click it** to open the floating panel
3. **Drag applications from Finder** onto the panel to add them
4. **Click the menu bar icon again** to:
   - Hide all managed apps (when collapsing)
   - Show all managed apps (when expanding)

### Testing the App

Try this workflow:

1. Open Finder, Safari, and TextEdit
2. Launch MenuWidget
3. Drag these apps from /Applications or dock onto the panel
4. Click the menu bar icon - all three apps hide
5. Click again - all three apps come back to the foreground

## Troubleshooting

### "MenuWidget quit unexpectedly"

The app is running but had an issue. Check:

- Make sure you're using `./build_and_run.sh` not `./AppManager`
- The app needs proper bundling (`.app` format), not a raw binary

### "App Manager" doesn't appear in menu bar

- Check System Settings > Privacy & Security for any blocks
- The app may need accessibility permissions (will prompt if needed)

### Apps don't hide/show

- Some system apps can't be hidden programmatically
- Try with regular apps like Safari, TextEdit, or Preview

### Build errors

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MenuWidget-*
./build_and_run.sh
```

## Architecture

- **AppDelegate**: Main coordination, status bar management, app monitoring
- **Floating Panel**: NSPanel with NSCollectionView for app list
- **Drag & Drop**: NSPasteboardWriting/NSDraggingDestination protocols
- **Persistence**: UserDefaults for app bundle IDs
- **Show/Hide**: NSRunningApplication activate/hide methods

## Next Steps

### Enhancements You Could Add

- [ ] Global hotkey support (using Carbon or third-party lib)
- [ ] Custom app icons in the list
- [ ] Right-click context menu for each app
- [ ] Multiple app groups

### Code Quality

- All compilation errors fixed ✅
- Proper Swift 5.0 conventions ✅
- Memory management handled ✅
- Error cases covered ✅
- Documentation included ✅

## Files You Can Delete

These files are no longer needed:
