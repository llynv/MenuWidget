# App Manager - macOS Menu Bar Utility

A macOS menu bar utility that allows you to manage application visibility by showing/hiding multiple applications with a single click.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Runs as a status item in the macOS menu bar (no dock icon)
- **Application Management**: Maintains a list of managed applications
- **Show/Hide Toggle**: Click the menu bar item to show/hide all managed applications
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Drag applications from Finder or other sources to add them to the managed list
- **Draggable Reordering**: Reorder applications within the panel by dragging

### User Interface
- **Floating Panel**: Semi-transparent panel that appears below the menu bar
- **Application Icons**: Each managed app displays its icon and name
- **Animations**: Smooth fade and slide animations for panel appearance
- **Auto-collapse**: Panel closes when clicking outside of it
- **Scrolling**: Supports many applications with scrollable list

### Persistence & Settings
- **Persistent Storage**: App list is saved to UserDefaults and restored on launch
- **Preferences Window**: Configure panel width, auto-collapse settings, and status icon visibility
- **Smart Validation**: Automatically removes terminated applications from the list

### Advanced Features
- **Multiple Display Support**: Panel positioning adapts to different screen configurations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigate with arrow keys, activate apps with Return, remove with Delete
- **Accessibility**: Proper accessibility labels and keyboard support
- **App Monitoring**: Automatically detects app launches and terminations

## Usage
